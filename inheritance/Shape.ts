//An abstract class is a class that is declared abstractâ€”it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.
//An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation (without braces, and followed by a semicolon), like this://
//abstract void moveTo(double deltaX, double deltaY);
//If a class includes abstract methods, then the class itself must be declared abstract, as in:
//public abstract class GraphicObject {
// declare fields
// declare nonabstract methods
// abstract void draw();
//}
//When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class.
//However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.

//cannot create instance of an abstract class
